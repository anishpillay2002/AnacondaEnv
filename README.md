# AnacondaEnv
## Introduction
This repository is generally to store 'yml' file to create an Anaconda Environment required to run a project in my account.  
I don't use anaconda for all my projects. The projects which contain 'anacondaenv' submodule are the one where you would need to create an environment by importing the 'yml' file

## Usage
Open Anaconda prompt and paste the following to create the desired environment
conda env create -f <location of the yml file>

## List of yml files
1.	MachineLearning.yml:  Used for computer vision and machine/deep learning projects
